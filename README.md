# 🚀 Prototype to Production: Building Multi-Agent Systems Using A2A Protocol

This project demonstrates how to design, implement, and scale **multi-agent systems** using the **Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication protocol**. It provides a fully runnable Google Colab environment with detailed code, explanations, and outputs for all tasks (Option C2).

---

## 📘 Overview

The goal of this project is to move from **prototype-level agents** to **production-ready multi-agent workflows**. Using the A2A protocol, agents can:

* communicate,
* coordinate tasks,
* exchange structured messages,
* and solve problems collaboratively.

This notebook shows a full working example of multi-agent communication using Python—no external setup required.

---

## 🔧 Key Features

* ✔️ Fully executable in **Google Colab**
* ✔️ Zero manual installation issues (dependencies auto-installed)
* ✔️ Clean agent architecture (Planner, Worker, Reviewer)
* ✔️ Step-by-step execution of all 6 tasks (Option C2)
* ✔️ Logging + message passing + workflow control
* ✔️ Beginner-friendly but production-ready code design
* ✔️ Copy–paste ready, runs instantly

## ▶️ How to Use (Google Colab)

1. Upload **colab_notebook.ipynb** or paste the full code into a new Colab notebook
2. Run all cells from top to bottom
3. Outputs for all **6 tasks** will be generated automatically
4. No installation errors — everything is pre-handled inside the notebook

---

## 📘 Tasks Included (Option C2)

Each task is executed by the agent team:

| Task       | Description               |
| ---------- | ------------------------- |
| **Task 1** | Planning workflow         |
| **Task 2** | Generating solution       |
| **Task 3** | Reviewing outcome         |
| **Task 4** | Multi-agent communication |
| **Task 5** | Final processed output    |
| **Task 6** | Consolidated report       |

Each output is cleanly printed in the notebook.
